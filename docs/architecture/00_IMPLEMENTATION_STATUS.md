## Risk Assessment by Tier

| Tier | Risk if Used Prematurely | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Tier 1 (Current)** | Low - test data only | [DONE] No real patient exposure |
| **Tier 2 (Phase 6)** | Medium - unvalidated for humans | WARNING: Cadavers/bench only |
| **Tier 3 (Phase 7)** | High - regulatory violation | [FAILED] Need IRB approval |
| **Tier 4 (Phase 8+)** | Critical - illegal use | [FAILED] Need FDA clearance |

**CRITICAL WARNING:**
- Using Tier 1 system for Tier 3 work (clinical trials) = **HIPAA violation** + **IRB violation** + potential **FDA enforcement action**
- Using Tier 1 system for Tier 4 work (production) = **Federal crime** (selling unapproved medical device)
