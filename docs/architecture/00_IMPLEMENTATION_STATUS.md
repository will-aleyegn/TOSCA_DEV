## Risk Assessment by Tier

| Tier | Risk if Used Prematurely | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Tier 1 (Current)** | Low - test data only | ✅ No real patient exposure |
| **Tier 2 (Phase 6)** | Medium - unvalidated for humans | ⚠️ Cadavers/bench only |
| **Tier 3 (Phase 7)** | High - regulatory violation | ❌ Need IRB approval |
| **Tier 4 (Phase 8+)** | Critical - illegal use | ❌ Need FDA clearance |

**CRITICAL WARNING:**
- Using Tier 1 system for Tier 3 work (clinical trials) = **HIPAA violation** + **IRB violation** + potential **FDA enforcement action**
- Using Tier 1 system for Tier 4 work (production) = **Federal crime** (selling unapproved medical device)

---

## Summary

**Current Capabilities (Tier 1):**
- Fully functional for **lab experimentation and R&D**
- **27 core features implemented and tested** (updated Oct 2025)
