# TOSCA Safety Shutdown Policy

**Document Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Active Policy
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Selective Shutdown Principle

### Core Policy

When safety interlocks fail or unsafe conditions are detected, **only the treatment laser** is immediately disabled. All other systems remain operational to support safe assessment and recovery.

This policy supersedes any previous documentation indicating full system shutdown.

## System-by-System Shutdown Rules

### Treatment Laser (SHUTDOWN)

**Action:** Immediate disable
**Methods:**
```python
laser_controller.set_output(False)  # Disable output
laser_controller.set_current(0.0)    # Zero power
```

**Rationale:**
- Primary hazard source
- Therapeutic power levels (up to 2000 mW)
- Immediate shutdown prevents tissue damage

**Recovery:** Requires manual safety clearance and system reset

---

### Camera System (MAINTAIN)

**Action:** Continue streaming
**Rationale:**
- **Essential for post-fault assessment:** Operator needs to see treatment area
- **Visual verification:** Confirms laser is actually off
- **Diagnostic value:** May show what caused the fault
- **No safety hazard:** Passive imaging only

**Example Use Cases:**
- Verify laser spot has disappeared
- Check for unexpected tissue reactions
- Document fault conditions
- Guide repositioning if needed

---

### Actuator System (MAINTAIN)

**Action:** Remain controllable
**Rationale:**
- **Safe repositioning:** May need to move away from treatment site
- **Controlled shutdown:** Allows precise parking position
- **Diagnostic access:** Can move to verify mechanical issues
- **Limited hazard:** Motion at controlled speeds, low force

**Restrictions After Fault:**
- Manual control only (no automatic protocols)
- Reduced speed limits (safety mode)
- Position bounds enforced
- Continuous operator supervision required

**Example Use Cases:**
- Move away from tissue after emergency stop
- Return to home position
- Clear workspace for fault investigation
- Position for camera inspection

---

### Aiming Laser (MAINTAIN)

**Action:** Keep available
**Rationale:**
- **Low power:** Typically <5 mW (Class 2, inherently safe)
- **Alignment verification:** Can check optical path alignment
- **Visual reference:** Shows where treatment would occur
- **Diagnostic tool:** Helps identify optical misalignment faults

**Safety Notes:**
- Class 2 laser (eye-safe with blink reflex)
- Different controller from treatment laser
- Independent power supply
- Can be manually disabled if desired

**Example Use Cases:**
- Verify optical alignment after fault
- Check for obstruction in beam path
- Confirm targeting accuracy
- Diagnose pointing stability issues

---

### Smoothing Device (CONDITIONAL)

**Action:** Depend on fault source

**If Smoothing Device IS the fault source:**
- Motor → OFF
- Safety interlock recognizes motor failure
- Treatment laser disabled (per policy)

**If Smoothing Device is NOT the fault source:**
- Motor continues running if already active
- Can be manually controlled
- Helps maintain component temperature stability
- May aid in diagnosis

**Rationale:**
- Device failure triggers selective shutdown (laser only)
- Device can continue if not implicated in fault
- Thermal stability may aid recovery
- No direct safety hazard from motor operation

---

### GPIO Monitoring (MAINTAIN)

**Action:** Continue all monitoring functions
**Rationale:**
- Heartbeat monitoring must continue (watchdog still active)
- Photodiode feedback confirms laser is off
- Vibration sensor shows motor state
- Essential for diagnosing root cause

**Monitored Signals:**
- Photodiode voltage → Should drop to <0.1V after laser shutdown
- Smoothing device vibration → Continues if motor running
- Watchdog heartbeat → Must continue for system health
- Safety interlock states → Track for diagnostics

---

## Implementation in Code

### Safety Manager Emergency Stop

```python
class SafetyManager:
    def emergency_stop(self, reason: str):
        """
        Selective emergency shutdown - TREATMENT LASER ONLY.

        Maintains operational: Camera, Actuator, Aiming Laser, GPIO monitoring
        """
        logger.critical(f"EMERGENCY STOP: {reason}")

        # 1. IMMEDIATE: Disable treatment laser only
        if self.laser_controller:
            self.laser_controller.set_output(False)
            self.laser_controller.set_current(0.0)
            logger.info("Treatment laser disabled (selective shutdown)")

        # 2. MAINTAIN: Other systems remain operational
        # - Camera continues streaming
        # - Actuator remains controllable
        # - Aiming laser stays available
        # - GPIO monitoring continues
        # - Event logging active

        # 3. Update system state
        self.system_state = SystemState.FAULT
        self.laser_enabled = False

        # 4. Log event
        self.event_logger.log_event(
            event_type=EventType.EMERGENCY_STOP,
            description=f"Emergency stop: {reason} (selective shutdown - laser only)",
            severity=EventSeverity.EMERGENCY
        )

        # 5. Notify UI
        self.safety_event.emit("emergency_stop", reason)
```

### Watchdog Failure Handler

```python
class SafetyWatchdog:
    def _handle_critical_failure(self):
        """
        Watchdog failure → Selective shutdown (treatment laser only).

        IMPORTANT: Does not shutdown entire system.
        """
        logger.critical("Watchdog critical failure - disabling TREATMENT LASER only")

        # 1. Disable treatment laser (selective shutdown)
        if self.laser_controller:
            self.laser_controller.set_output(False)
            self.laser_controller.set_current(0.0)

        # 2. Other systems maintained:
        # - Camera: Continues monitoring
        # - Actuator: Remains controllable
        # - Aiming laser: Available
        # - GPIO: Heartbeat stops but monitoring continues

        # 3. Stop watchdog heartbeat (connection lost)
        self.stop()

        # 4. Emit critical signal
        self.watchdog_timeout_detected.emit()

        # 5. Log event
        self.event_logger.log_event(
            event_type=EventType.WATCHDOG_FAILURE,
            description="Watchdog failure - treatment laser disabled (selective shutdown)",
            severity=EventSeverity.EMERGENCY
        )
```

### Protocol Engine Safety Check

```python
class ProtocolEngine:
    def _on_safety_failure_during_protocol(self):
        """
        Real-time safety failure during protocol execution.

        Selective shutdown: Stops laser, maintains monitoring.
        """
        logger.critical("Safety interlock failure during protocol execution")

        # 1. Stop protocol execution
        self.stop()  # Stops protocol, sets state to STOPPED

        # 2. Disable treatment laser (selective shutdown)
        if self.laser:
            self.laser.set_output(False)
            self.laser.set_current(0.0)

        # 3. Maintain support systems:
        # - Camera continues (operator can see what happened)
        # - Actuator controllable (can reposition if needed)
        # - Event log captures full context

        # 4. Log event
        self.event_logger.log_event(
            event_type=EventType.PROTOCOL_SAFETY_STOP,
            description="Protocol stopped due to safety interlock failure (selective shutdown)",
            severity=EventSeverity.CRITICAL
        )
```

## Rationale for Selective Shutdown

### Patient Safety Benefits

1. **Visual Confirmation:** Operator can immediately see treatment area after fault
2. **Repositioning:** Can move away from target safely if needed
3. **Assessment:** Camera shows tissue state and reaction
4. **Documentation:** Visual record of fault conditions

### Diagnostic Benefits

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Systems remain available for testing
2. **State Preservation:** Actuator position, camera view maintained
3. **Signal Monitoring:** GPIO continues reading sensor states
4. **Reproducibility:** Can attempt to reproduce fault with laser disabled

### Operational Benefits

1. **Reduced Downtime:** Don't need to restart entire system
2. **Faster Recovery:** Selective re-enable after fault clearance
3. **Better UX:** Operator retains control and visibility
4. **Training:** Safer environment for operator training

### Safety Validation

**Key Principle:** Treatment laser is the **only** hazard requiring immediate shutdown.

**System Risk Analysis:**
- **Camera:** No harm possible (passive imaging)
- **Actuator:** Low force, controlled motion, operator supervised
- **Aiming Laser:** Class 2, eye-safe, inherently low risk
- **Smoothing Device:** Mechanical device, no direct patient contact
- **Treatment Laser:** High power (2000 mW), tissue-damaging, **must** be disabled

**Conclusion:** Selective shutdown optimizes both safety and functionality.

## Recovery Procedures

### After Selective Shutdown

**Immediate Actions:**
1. [DONE] Verify treatment laser OFF (check photodiode < 0.1V)
2. [DONE] Assess patient/tissue status visually (camera)
3. [DONE] Document fault conditions in event log
4. [DONE] Determine root cause

**Before Re-enabling Treatment Laser:**
1. Clear the fault condition
2. Verify all safety interlocks pass
3. Confirm support systems operational
4. Reset safety manager state
5. Supervisor authorization required
6. Document recovery in event log

## Testing Requirements

### Selective Shutdown Tests

**Test 1:** Emergency Stop Button
- Press E-stop during treatment
- **Verify:** Laser OFF, camera ON, actuator controllable
- **Verify:** Photodiode reads <0.1V
- **Verify:** UI shows fault state but remains responsive

**Test 2:** Watchdog Timeout
- Simulate GUI freeze
- **Verify:** Treatment laser OFF after 1 second
- **Verify:** Camera still streaming
- **Verify:** Event log records fault

**Test 3:** Safety Interlock Failure (Smoothing Device)
- Stop smoothing motor during treatment
- **Verify:** Laser OFF immediately
- **Verify:** Motor stops, but camera/actuator available
- **Verify:** Operator can reposition

**Test 4:** Selective Recovery
- After fault, clear root cause
- **Verify:** Can re-enable laser with supervisor auth
- **Verify:** All interlocks must pass before re-enable
- **Verify:** Event log documents full recovery sequence
