PROP 16 bits Closed loop Proportional control factor for zone 1. Default: 100.
PRO2 16 bits Closed loop Proportional control factor for zone 2. Default: 100.
ZON1 26 bits Closed loop Width of zone 1: +/- value around target position. Expressed
in encoder units. Default: 100.
ZON2 26 bits Closed loop Width of zone 2: +/- value around target position. Expressed
in encoder units. Default: 1000.
CFRQ 16 bits Closed loop Control frequency. Adapt this value to obtain stable closed-
loop control. The optimal control frequency depends on the
mass or inertia of the load. Default: 30000 (30 000 Hz) for zero
load.
DUCO 1 bit Closed loop Amplitude is used in closed loop if set to 1. If set to 0, a fixed
amplitude of 50% is used. Default: 1.
ELIM 20 bits Closed loop ELIM (error limit) sets the maximum following error. When
the following error exceeds the value set bij ELIM, then the
controller goes in safe mode and the motor signals are
switched off. Recovery: RSET or ENBL=1
This error may be triggered when trying to move beyond the
physical limits of the stage, or by setting a too high speed. Do
not forget to first find the index position (INDX command) to
avoid that the stage travels beyond the end stops and triggers
this error.
Default: 10000.
ILIM 26 bits Closed loop Sets the following-error at which the index search algorithm
reverses direction. This influences the time the stage stalls at
the end position during an index search.
PTOL 16 bits Closed loop Position tolerance. When the stage is within +/- position
tolerance of the desired position, the control is switched off
and the ‘position reached’ flag is raised.
Values are expressed in encoder units and should be in the
range 0 – 65535. The range is applied symmetrically with
respect to positive and negative position errors. e.g. PTOL=2
allows s errors between -2 and +2 encoder units.
Default: 2.
See also TOUT and PTO2.
PTO2 16 bits Closed loop Second position tolerance, similar to PTOL. Comes into action
if first position tolerance PTOL fails within a timeout time
TOUT. The default value is 10.
TOUT 16 bits Closed loop Set timeout time. To avoid that the stage keeps vibrating
indefinitely around the desired position without ‘landing’, a
www.xeryon.com Page 16 of 56 v3.25
timeout time can be set. The timer starts when the stage is
near the desired position, within a distance of +/- PTO2. After
passing the timeout time, PTO2 becomes the new position
tolerance.
The time is expressed in milliseconds. The default value is 50
(50 ms).
Also check PTOL and PTO2.
TOU2 16 bits Closed loop This defines a safety timeout. When the motor is on for a time
longer that the value set by TOU2, then the controller goes in
safe mode and the motor signals are switched off. Recovery:
RSET or ENBL=1 depending on BLCK.
Status bit #18 goes up when this timeout is triggered.
TOU2=0 disables this timeout. Any other value sets the
timeout time in seconds. Maximum value: 65535 seconds
TOU3 16 bits Closed loop This defines another safety timeout. When the stage is trying
to “land” to a specific position for longer than the value set by
TOU3, then the controller goes in safe mode. The motor
signals are switched off.
Status bit #
ENCR 1 bit Closed loop Reset the encoder by sending “ENCR=1”.

5.3. Feedback from controller
Information is sent back from the Xeryon controller to the master (PC) in ASCII format. The format is
as follows:
1. One character identifying the axis, followed by a colon. This only applies to multiple-axes
systems. For a single-axis system the axis identification is omitted.
2. Tag: Four characters describing the type of information
3. ‘=’ sign separating the command from the corresponding value
4. Signed value associated with that information (sign + 8 decimal places). The message is
terminated with a ‘new line’ character (ASCII code 10).
e.g. X:EPOS=+12345678
Different types of information:
For multiple-axis systems this information is being sent for every axis. First all data for axis 1, then all
data for axis 2, … . The command INFO determines which information is sent back.
