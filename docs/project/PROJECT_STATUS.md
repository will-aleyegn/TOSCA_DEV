## Recent Work (Last 10 Sessions)

### Actuator HAL Implementation (2025-10-23)

**Session 11: Actuator Initialization & Code Cleanup**
1. ✅ Fixed 6 Xeryon API integration issues in actuator_controller.py
   - Fixed axis letter mismatch (A → X to match config.txt)
   - Corrected axis registration using addAxis(Stage, letter)
   - Fixed method names: setUnit() → setUnits(), makeStep() → step()
   - Fixed getEPOS() signature (removed units parameter)
   - Removed non-existent isInSafeMode() method
2. ✅ Successfully tested hardware connection (COM3, 9600 baud)
3. ✅ Created test_actuator_connection.py for non-interactive testing
4. ✅ Removed all decorative emojis from example scripts (8 instances across 4 files)
   - 03_find_index.py, 04_absolute_positioning.py
   - 05_relative_movement.py, 06_speed_and_limits.py
5. ✅ Status: Actuator connects successfully, reports position, ready for homing tests

**Lessons Learned:**
- Xeryon API uses addAxis(stage, letter) not Axis() constructor
- Config file axis letter must match code ("X" in config.txt)
- getEPOS() uses current units set by setUnits(), no parameter needed

5. Test with physical hardware
6. Document lessons learned

**Reference Files:**
- components/actuator_module/ (Xeryon API patterns)

## Known Issues & Lessons Learned

**Camera Module:**
- VmbPy uses British spelling: `is_writeable()` not `is_writable()`
- Streaming callback requires 3 parameters: (cam, stream, frame)
- Use `get_feature_by_name()` instead of direct attribute access for features
- AcquisitionFrameRate range is dynamic based on camera configuration
- Camera may report very low max FPS (0.45) even when capable of 40+ FPS
- Always query valid ranges before setting hardware features
- See components/camera_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md for complete list (5 documented issues)

**Actuator Module:**
- See components/actuator_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md (when created)

**GUI:**
- ✅ Camera widget now has full live streaming functionality
- Safety widget shows placeholder only
- Subject selection not connected to database

**Safety System:**
- Not implemented yet
- Critical for laser operation

**New Project-Wide Rule:**
- **Always use native hardware API features before implementing software workarounds**
- Query valid ranges and implement graceful fallbacks
- Document why software solutions are used if hardware doesn't support feature
- See CODING_STANDARDS.md "Hardware API Usage" section

## Decision Log

**2025-10-23 (Session 10):**
- **Established project-wide "Hardware API Usage" rule**
- Reason: Discovered we implemented software frame throttling when camera has native AcquisitionFrameRate control
- Impact: Now required to check hardware API documentation before implementing any hardware control feature
- Files: CODING_STANDARDS.md, START_HERE.md, camera_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md
- Status: Top priority in code review checklist

**2025-10-23 (Session 9):**
- **Implement hardware frame rate control with graceful fallback**
- Reason: Camera's AcquisitionFrameRate has dynamic range (may be 0.45 FPS even when capable of 40+ FPS)
- Solution: Try hardware control first, fall back to software throttling if hardware doesn't support desired rate
- Impact: Maintains "hardware API first" principle with practical handling of limitations

**2025-10-23 (Session 8):**
- **Use hardware AcquisitionFrameRate API for frame rate control**
- Reason: Initially implemented software throttling, discovered hardware has native feature
- Impact: Better performance, reliability, and simplicity
- Lesson: Always check hardware API documentation first

**2025-10-23 (Session 6):**
- **Create comprehensive camera HAL testing documentation**
- Reason: Physical hardware testing requires systematic procedures
- Files: CAMERA_HAL_TEST_GUIDE.md (17 tests), test_hal_integration.py, TESTING_QUICK_START.md

**2025-10-23:**
- Excluded vendor code (Allied Vision examples, VmbPy tests) from pre-commit linting
- Reason: Third-party code doesn't need to follow our standards
- Files: Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml

**2025-10-22:**
- Use FastTransformation for GUI frame scaling instead of SmoothTransformation
- Reason: Performance - reduced overhead by ~45ms per frame
- Impact: Slightly lower visual quality but much better performance

7. Test with physical hardware throughout development

**For Camera HAL maintenance/enhancement:**
1. ✅ Core functionality complete
2. Optional: Capture screenshots following SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md
3. Optional: Add more camera features (triggers, pixel formats, etc.)
4. Document any new discoveries in LESSONS_LEARNED.md

**If starting something new:**
1. Check this file for current priorities (Priority 2: Laser or Actuator HAL)
2. Review relevant architecture docs

4. Follow CODING_STANDARDS.md (especially Hardware API Usage rule)

**Always:**
1. Read GIT_CONTENT_POLICY.md first
2. Read START_HERE.md for quick onboarding
3. Check hardware API documentation BEFORE implementing
4. Update WORK_LOG.md during work
5. Update this file when milestones reached
