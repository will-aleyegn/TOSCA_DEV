## Current Focus

**Priority 1:** Camera Hardware Abstraction Layer

**Why:** Foundation for all image processing and alignment features

**Tasks:**
1. Create camera_controller.py with VmbPy integration
2. Implement thread-safe frame streaming
3. Add PyQt6 signals for frame updates
4. Integrate with camera_widget.py for live display
5. Add video recording capability

**Reference Files:**
- components/camera_module/README.md (API patterns)
- components/camera_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md (API quirks)
- components/camera_module/INTEGRATION_FEATURES.md (PyQt6 patterns)
- docs/architecture/05_image_processing.md (requirements)

## Known Issues

**Camera Module:**
- VmbPy uses British spelling: `is_writeable()` not `is_writable()`
- Streaming callback requires 3 parameters: (cam, stream, frame)
- See components/camera_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md for complete list

**Actuator Module:**
- See components/actuator_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md (when created)

**GUI:**
- Camera widget shows placeholder only
- Safety widget shows placeholder only
- Subject selection not connected to database

**Safety System:**
- Not implemented yet
- Critical for laser operation

---

## Decision Log

**2025-10-23:**
- Excluded vendor code (Allied Vision examples, VmbPy tests) from pre-commit linting
- Reason: Third-party code doesn't need to follow our standards
- Files: Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml

**2025-10-22:**
- Use FastTransformation for GUI frame scaling instead of SmoothTransformation
- Reason: Performance - reduced overhead by ~45ms per frame
- Impact: Slightly lower visual quality but much better performance

**2025-10-22:**
- Added presubmit reminder hook
- Reason: Ensure documentation stays updated
- Note: Always passes, never blocks commits

## Next Session Recommendations

**If continuing camera HAL work:**
1. Read components/camera_module/INTEGRATION_FEATURES.md
2. Review PyQt6 threading patterns
3. Start camera_controller.py implementation
4. Test with camera_widget.py integration

**If starting something new:**
1. Check this file for current priorities
2. Review relevant architecture docs
3. Update WORK_LOG.md with your plan
4. Follow CODING_STANDARDS.md

**Always:**
1. Read GIT_CONTENT_POLICY.md first
2. Update WORK_LOG.md during work
3. Update this file when milestones reached
4. Run pre-commit hooks before committing
