### Session: Actuator Homing Success - CRITICAL FIX

**Time:** Mid-day debugging session

**STATUS: ACTUATOR HOMING NOW WORKING! ✓**

**CRITICAL FINDING - AUTO_SEND_SETTINGS:**

**THE FIX:** `AUTO_SEND_SETTINGS = False` in Xeryon.py (line 36)

**WHY:** The device already has correct settings stored from Windows Interface. Overwriting these settings with values from settings_user.txt was triggering persistent thermal protection errors (STAT bits 2 & 3) that prevented motor movement and caused homing to fail.

**Actions:**
1. **Debugged persistent thermal protection errors:**
   - Created debug_homing.py to monitor STAT register in real-time
   - Found: Hardware starts index search but aborts after 100ms
   - Root cause: Thermal errors preventing motor movement
   - STAT register shows bits 2 & 3 (thermal protection 1 & 2) constantly set

2. **Isolated thermal error trigger:**
   - Created test_no_reset.py to test initialization without reset()
   - Found: Thermal errors NOT caused by reset()
   - Found: Thermal errors triggered by sendSettings() call
   - Before sendSettings(): STAT=17, no thermal errors ✓
   - After sendSettings(): STAT=29, thermal errors present ✗

3. **Applied fix - Use device's stored settings:**
   - Set AUTO_SEND_SETTINGS = False (was True)
   - This prevents overwriting device's working configuration
   - Device settings configured via Windows Interface are preserved

4. **Additional fixes applied during debugging:**
   - Changed Stage type: XLA_1250 → XLA_1250_5N (5 Newton motor)
   - Added 500ms grace period in findIndex() for STAT register update
   - Set DISABLE_WAITING = False for reliable blocking behavior
   - Removed redundant SSPD/LLIM/HLIM commands after start()

**Test Results (test_actuator_connection.py):**
```
Searching index for axis X.
Index of axis X found.
Auto-homing complete - actuator ready

Status:
  connected: True
  homed: True
  position_um: 1.25
  encoder_valid: True
  status: ready
```

**Zero thermal errors! Perfect initialization!**

**Files Modified:**
- components/actuator_module/Xeryon.py:
  - Line 29: DISABLE_WAITING = False (was True)
  - Line 36: AUTO_SEND_SETTINGS = False (was True) **← CRITICAL FIX**
  - Line 40: AUTO_SEND_ENBL = True (auto-clear thermal errors)
  - Line 388: Added 500ms grace period in findIndex()
- src/hardware/actuator_controller.py:
  - Line 120: Stage.XLA_1250_5N (was Stage.XLA_1250)
  - Lines 134-141: Removed redundant setting commands
  - Lines 151-164: Added pre-homing status debug logging

**Files Created (diagnostic):**
- debug_homing.py - STAT register monitoring
- test_no_reset.py - Initialization sequence testing
- test_thermal_clearing.py - Thermal error clearing strategies
- test_minimal_settings.py - Individual setting testing

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Device's stored settings are authoritative** - Don't overwrite with file-based settings
- Windows Interface configures device properly - trust those settings
- Sending incompatible settings triggers hardware protection mechanisms
- Thermal protection can prevent motor movement even without actual overheating
- STAT register needs time to update after commands (POLI=97ms polling interval)
- Always test with minimal changes first when debugging hardware issues

**Current Status:**
- Actuator HAL: 75% complete (connection + homing working)
- Connection: PASSING ✓
- Homing: PASSING ✓
- Status reporting: WORKING ✓
- Next: Position control and movement testing

### Session: Actuator HAL Initialization

**Time:** Late evening session

**Actions:**
1. Fixed Xeryon API integration in actuator_controller.py:
   - Issue: Axis letter mismatch ("A" in code vs "X" in config.txt)
   - Issue: Incorrect axis registration pattern
   - Issue: Wrong method names (setUnit → setUnits, makeStep → step)
   - Issue: getEPOS() called with units parameter (should use none)
   - Issue: Non-existent isInSafeMode() method in status reporting
   - Solution: Consulted Xeryon.py source code and official examples
   - Result: All 6 API issues fixed

2. Created test_actuator_connection.py:
   - Non-interactive connection test
   - Validates COM port, config files, initialization
   - Reports full status information
   - Result: Connection successful on COM3, 9600 baud

3. Removed decorative emojis from example scripts:
   - Per CODING_STANDARDS.md line 9: "No decorative elements"
   - Files: 03_find_index.py, 04_absolute_positioning.py, 05_relative_movement.py, 06_speed_and_limits.py
   - Removed: ✓, ✗, ⚠ symbols (8 total instances)
   - Result: All examples now conform to coding standards

**Decisions:**
- Used addAxis(Stage.XLA_1250_3N, "X") instead of Axis() constructor
- Axis letter "X" matches config.txt: AXES=1 X
- Config files (config.txt, settings_default.txt) in repo root for accessibility

**Files Modified:**
- src/hardware/actuator_controller.py (6 API fixes)
- test_actuator_connection.py (created)
- components/actuator_module/examples/*.py (4 files, emoji removal)

**Files Added:**
- test_actuator_connection.py
- test_actuator_hal.py (emoji fix)

**Current Status:**
- Actuator HAL: 50% complete (initialization done)
- Connection test: PASSING
- Status reporting: Working (connected, homed, position, encoder_valid, etc.)
- Next: Homing procedure testing with physical hardware

**Lessons Learned:**
- Xeryon addAxis() signature: addAxis(stage, axis_letter) - stage first
- Axis constructor doesn't auto-register, must use addAxis()
- getEPOS() returns position in current units (set by setUnits())
- Config file axis letter must match code exactly

### Session: Camera UI Performance and Metadata Display

**Time:** Evening session

**Actions:**
1. Added real-time camera settings metadata display:
   - Created info bar below FPS counter
   - Shows live exposure value (microseconds)
   - Shows live gain value (dB)
   - Shows current frame resolution
   - Auto-updates when settings change
   - Styled with subtle gray color for secondary info

2. Implemented frame throttling for GUI performance:
   - Identified root cause: All 39-40 camera frames/sec overwhelming Qt event loop
   - Added frame throttling in CameraStreamThread
   - Limits GUI updates to 30 FPS target
   - Still captures all camera frames for recording/statistics
   - Calculates real camera FPS separately from GUI update rate
   - Uses time-based gating (min_frame_interval = 1.0 / gui_fps_target)

3. Technical implementation details:
   - Added gui_frame_count, last_gui_frame_time, gui_fps_target tracking
   - Frame callback now checks time since last GUI frame emission
   - Only emits to GUI when sufficient time has elapsed
   - Maintains accurate camera FPS calculation on all frames

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py:95-112` - Added settings info bar layout
- `src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py:443-445,461-463` - Updated info displays on setting changes
- `src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py:565-574` - Update resolution info on frame received
- `src/hardware/camera_controller.py:49-52` - Added throttling member variables
- `src/hardware/camera_controller.py:73-81` - Implemented throttling logic in frame_callback

**Results:**
- GUI now updates smoothly at 30 FPS instead of stuttering
- Users can see real-time camera settings at a glance
- Camera still captures at full rate (39-40 FPS) for recording
- Responsive UI with accurate information display

**Commit:** da8ac5e "Improve camera UI responsiveness and add settings display"
