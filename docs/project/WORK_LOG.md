### Session: Project Documentation Setup

**Time:** Morning session

**Actions:**
1. Created comprehensive project documentation files:
   - docs/project/GIT_CONTENT_POLICY.md - Git content policy and rules
   - docs/project/START_HERE.md - Quick 5-step setup guide
   - docs/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md - Complete project status tracking
   - docs/project/WORK_LOG.md - This file (real-time work tracking)

2. Committed camera module test suite expansion:
   - Added TEST_SUITE.md with complete documentation
   - Added 12 official Allied Vision Vimba 6.0 examples
   - Added VmbPy SDK unit tests (24+ tests)
   - Added test_camera_performance.py for performance validation
   - Updated README.md with test suite references
   - Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml to exclude vendor code from linting

**Decisions:**
- Exclude third-party vendor code (Allied Vision examples, VmbPy tests) from pre-commit linting
  - Reason: Vendor code doesn't need to follow our project standards
  - Implementation: Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml exclude patterns

**Issues Resolved:**
- Pre-commit hooks failing on vendor code
  - Solution: Added exclude patterns for official_allied_vision/ and vmbpy_unit_tests/
- test_camera_performance.py linting errors
  - Solution: Added type hints, removed unused variable, fixed f-string formatting

**Files Modified:**
- .pre-commit-config.yaml
- components/camera_module/README.md
- components/camera_module/TEST_SUITE.md (new)
- components/camera_module/examples/test_camera_performance.py
- docs/project/GIT_CONTENT_POLICY.md (new)
- docs/project/START_HERE.md (new)
- docs/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md (new)
- docs/project/WORK_LOG.md (new)

**Commits:**
- bafd48e - Add comprehensive camera test suite and documentation

**Next Steps:**
- Commit documentation files
- Begin Camera HAL implementation (camera_controller.py)
- Review INTEGRATION_FEATURES.md for PyQt6 patterns

### Session: Camera Performance Optimization

**Actions:**
1. Fixed camera frame update performance issues
   - Removed unnecessary frame.copy() calls
   - Changed GUI scaling from SmoothTransformation to FastTransformation
   - Reduced per-frame overhead by ~45ms

2. Modernized CONFIGURATION.md
   - Removed MCP references
   - Updated to reflect current file structure

3. Enhanced presubmit reminder hook
   - Made reminder output verbose
   - Added clear documentation update prompts

**Commits:**
- fab5671 - Fix camera frame update performance issues
- 87bb72b - Modernize CONFIGURATION.md - remove MCP references and update to current files
- 28784bd - Make presubmit reminder verbose
- 8234426 - Add presubmit documentation reminder hook
- d3bdc05 - Add developer/tech mode for session-independent operation

**Impact:**
- Camera live view now runs at full frame rate (~39-40 FPS)
- Significantly improved UI responsiveness

### Session: Camera Integration with Live View

**Actions:**
1. Enhanced camera controls
   - Added input boxes for direct parameter entry
   - Implemented auto exposure settings
   - Improved control layout and usability

2. Added camera integration with live view
   - Real-time camera feed in GUI
   - Frame rate display
   - Control panel integration

**Commits:**
- 7839c69 - Enhance camera controls with input boxes and auto settings
- af84aad - Add camera integration with live view and controls

**Lessons Learned:**
- VmbPy frame callbacks require 3 parameters: (cam, stream, frame)
- Frame conversion can be expensive - avoid unnecessary copies
- GUI scaling method significantly affects performance

### Session: Camera API Exploration

**Actions:**
1. Developed 6 camera test scripts:
   - 01_list_cameras.py - Camera detection
   - 02_camera_info.py - Camera information
   - 03_capture_single_frame.py - Single frame capture
   - 04_explore_features.py - Feature enumeration
   - 05_continuous_stream.py - Streaming test
   - 06_set_auto_exposure.py - Auto exposure test

2. Created comprehensive camera documentation:
   - components/camera_module/README.md (500+ lines)
   - components/camera_module/LESSONS_LEARNED.md (API quirks)
   - components/camera_module/INTEGRATION_FEATURES.md (PyQt6 patterns)

**Issues Discovered:**
1. VmbPy uses British spelling: `is_writeable()` not `is_writable()`
2. Streaming callback signature: requires 3 params (cam, stream, frame)
3. Relative paths break when scripts run from different directories

**Solutions:**
- Documented all quirks in LESSONS_LEARNED.md
- Use Path(__file__) for script-relative paths
- Always verify callback signatures from error messages
