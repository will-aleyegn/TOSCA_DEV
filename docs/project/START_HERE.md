# START HERE - Quick Session Setup

**For New AI Sessions**

## 1. Read These Files (In Order)

1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** ← Current project state, what's done, what's next
2. **CODING_STANDARDS.md** ← Development rules (CRITICAL)
3. **docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md** ← Reference if needed

## 2. Check Current State

```bash
cd C:\Users\wille\Desktop\TOSCA-dev
git status
git log --oneline -10
```

## 3. Activate Environment

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 4. Ask User

"I've reviewed the project status. We were working on [TASK FROM PROJECT_STATUS.md]. Should we continue with that, or would you like to work on something else?"

## 5. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md

As work progresses, update:
- "Current Work Session Summary"
- "Next Immediate Tasks"
- "Session Handoff Template"

---

**That's it! Start coding according to CODING_STANDARDS.md**
