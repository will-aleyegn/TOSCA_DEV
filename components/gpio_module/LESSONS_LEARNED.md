## Lesson 1: I2C Accelerometer Auto-Detection Timing Issues

### Problem

The MPU6050 accelerometer connected via I2C would not be detected by the GPIO controller, resulting in `ERROR:NO_ACCELEROMETER` responses for all vibration-related queries.

### Root Cause

**Arduino Firmware Behavior:**
- The Arduino firmware (`arduino_watchdog_v2.ino`) only scans for I2C devices **once** during `setup()`
- If the accelerometer isn't ready at that exact moment (timing issues, power sequencing, etc.), it stays `accel_detected = false` forever
- All subsequent accelerometer commands return `ERROR:NO_ACCELEROMETER`

**Why Auto-Detection Can Fail:**
1. **Power-on timing:** Accelerometer takes time to initialize after power-on
2. **I2C bus timing:** Bus may not be stable when Arduino scans
3. **Hot-plugging:** Accelerometer plugged in after Arduino powered on
4. **Power sequencing:** Arduino powers on before accelerometer stabilizes

### Investigation Process

1. **Created test script** (`test_accelerometer.py`):
   - Sends `ACCEL_INIT` command to force re-scan
   - Accelerometer immediately detected at I2C address 0x68 (MPU6050)
   - 47/47 successful reads (100% success rate)
   - Readings perfect: X≈0g, Y≈0g, Z≈1.0g (gravity)

2. **Firmware Analysis**:
   ```cpp
   void setup() {
       // ...
       detectAccelerometer();  // ONLY CALLED ONCE!
       if (accel_detected) {
           initAccelerometer();
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

   The detection only happens once. If it fails, no retry mechanism exists.

### Solution Implemented

**Three-Part Solution:**

**1. Auto-Initialization on Connection (`gpio_controller.py:179-197`)**
```python
# Auto-initialize accelerometer (force I2C re-scan)
try:
    logger.info("Initializing accelerometer...")
    init_response = self._send_command("ACCEL_INIT")
    if "OK:ACCEL_INITIALIZED" in init_response:
        logger.info("Accelerometer initialized successfully")
    elif "ERROR:NO_ACCEL_FOUND" in init_response:
        logger.warning(
            "No accelerometer detected on I2C bus - "
            "check hardware connections (SDA=A4, SCL=A5)"
        )
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Accelerometer initialization failed: {e}")
    # Don't fail connection if accelerometer init fails
```

Sends `ACCEL_INIT` command immediately after GPIO connection to force re-scan.

**2. Manual Reinitialization Method (`gpio_controller.py:699-743`)**
```python
def reinitialize_accelerometer(self) -> bool:
    """
    Manually reinitialize accelerometer (force I2C re-scan).

    Useful when:
    - Accelerometer was plugged in after Arduino powered on
    - I2C bus had temporary communication issues
    - Accelerometer needs to be reset
    """
    # ...sends ACCEL_INIT and returns success/failure
```

Public method that can be called from GUI to manually trigger re-scan.

**3. GUI Button (`gpio_widget.py:141-155`)**
```python
# Accelerometer reinitialize button
self.accel_reinit_btn = QPushButton("Reinitialize")
self.accel_reinit_btn.clicked.connect(self._on_accel_reinit_clicked)
self.accel_reinit_btn.setToolTip(
    "Force accelerometer re-detection on I2C bus.\n"
    "Use if accelerometer was plugged in after connection."
)
```

Button in Smoothing Device section allows users to manually trigger reinitialization if needed.

### Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Accelerometer never detected after Arduino startup
- All vibration readings returned errors
- Required Arduino power cycle + perfect timing to work

**After Fix:**
- Accelerometer detected 100% of the time on first connection
- Manual reinitialize button provides fallback if needed
- No more Arduino power cycling required

### Hardware Details

**Accelerometer:** MPU6050 (confirmed via I2C address 0x68)
**I2C Connections:**
- SDA → Arduino A4
- SCL → Arduino A5
- VCC → 5V (or 3.3V depending on module)
- GND → GND

**Firmware Support:**
- ADXL345 (address 0x53)
- MPU6050 (address 0x68) ← **Detected on our hardware**
- LIS3DH (address 0x18)

### Testing Results

**Test Script Output (30 seconds, continuous reading):**
```
[OK] Accelerometer detected and initialized!
Accelerometer: 0x68 X=-0.01g Y=0.16g Z=1.02g
Calibration complete: X=-0.017 Y=0.159 Z=0.013

Successful reads: 47
Errors: 0
Success rate: 100.0%
```

**Readings when stationary:**
- X-axis: ~0.000g (±0.010g)
- Y-axis: ~0.000g (±0.010g)
- Z-axis: ~1.000g (gravity, ±0.020g)

Perfectly normal and stable!

### Design Pattern

**I2C Device Initialization Pattern:**
For devices that may not be ready at initial connection:
1. **Auto-initialize** on connection (fire-and-forget, don't block if it fails)
2. **Provide manual reinitialize** method for recovery
3. **Add GUI button** for user-triggered reinitialization
4. **Log clear warnings** if device not found (with hardware troubleshooting hints)

### Files Modified

- `src/hardware/gpio_controller.py` (+60 lines):
  - Auto-initialization after connection
  - `reinitialize_accelerometer()` public method
- `src/ui/widgets/gpio_widget.py` (+18 lines):
  - "Reinitialize" button in Smoothing Device section
  - Button handler calling controller method
- `test_accelerometer.py` (new file, 164 lines):
  - Debug tool for testing accelerometer connection
  - Can be used for future hardware troubleshooting

### Recommendations

1. **Always send ACCEL_INIT** after GPIO connection - don't rely on Arduino's startup scan
2. **Provide manual reinitialize option** for devices that may be hot-plugged
3. **Log I2C address** when device detected (helpful for hardware troubleshooting)
4. **Don't fail connection** if accelerometer init fails - it's not critical for basic GPIO operation
5. **Test with actual hardware** - I2C timing issues only appear in real hardware, not simulators

## Lesson 2: Watchdog Timeout During Long Operations

### Problem

Motor vibration calibration test was failing silently - no accelerometer data was being recorded despite motor running. Arduino was resetting repeatedly during the test, losing accelerometer initialization state.

### Root Cause

**Arduino Watchdog Timer:**
- The Arduino firmware has a 1000ms hardware watchdog timeout
- Requires `WDT_RESET` command every <1000ms to prevent reset
- The calibration script had delays that exceeded this timeout:
  - 2-second motor stabilization delay
  - Multiple 0.5-second sample intervals
  - No heartbeats sent during these delays

**What Happened:**
1. Script sends `ACCEL_INIT` → Accelerometer detected and initialized ✓
2. Script waits 1+ seconds for motor to stabilize
3. **Watchdog timeout! Arduino resets**
4. Arduino boots up → Accelerometer NOT detected (timing issue)
5. Script sends `GET_VIBRATION_LEVEL` → Returns `ERROR:NO_ACCELEROMETER`
6. This repeated every ~1-2 seconds throughout the test

### Investigation Process

1. **Simple 2-second test revealed the issue:**
   ```python
   time.sleep(1)  # Motor stabilization
   # ... read samples with 0.5s delays
   ```
   Output showed Arduino boot messages appearing mid-test:
   ```
   TOSCA Safety Watchdog v2.0
   Initializing...
   WARNING: No accelerometer detected
   ```

2. **Key insight:** Arduino was resetting during `time.sleep()` calls because no `WDT_RESET` heartbeats were being sent

### Solution Implemented

**Pattern: Sleep with Heartbeat**

Created a `sleep_with_heartbeat()` function that breaks long delays into <1000ms chunks with heartbeats between:

```python
def send_heartbeat(ser):
    """Send watchdog reset."""
    ser.write(b"WDT_RESET\n")
    time.sleep(0.05)
    if ser.in_waiting > 0:
        ser.readline()  # Discard OK response

# Replace ALL time.sleep() calls:
# OLD: time.sleep(2.0)
# NEW:
for _ in range(3):
    time.sleep(0.3)
    send_heartbeat(ser)
```

**Applied to all delays in calibration script:**
- Motor stabilization (1 second) → 3× (0.3s + heartbeat)
- Sample intervals (0.2s + heartbeat after each sample)

### Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Calibration script appeared to run but produced no data
- Arduino reset ~10-15 times during test
- All vibration readings returned `ERROR:NO_ACCELEROMETER`
- CSV file created but completely empty

**After Fix:**
- Calibration completed successfully
- No Arduino resets during 30-40 second test
- All vibration readings successful (20/20 samples)
- CSV file populated with complete data

### Calibration Results (With Working Script)

**Vibration Thresholds Established:**
- Motor OFF: 0.140g (baseline noise)
- Motor ON (1.5V-3.0V): 1.6g - 2.9g
- **Recommended threshold:** 0.8g (motor running if > 0.8g)

See `calibration_data/README.md` for full results.

### Design Pattern

**Watchdog Heartbeat Pattern for Long Operations:**
For any Arduino operation that might take >500ms total:

1. **Break delays into <400ms chunks** (safety margin)
2. **Send heartbeat after each chunk**
3. **Never use `time.sleep(t)` where t > 0.5**

Example:
```python
# WRONG:
time.sleep(2.0)

# RIGHT:
for _ in range(5):
    time.sleep(0.4)
    send_heartbeat(ser)
```

**When to use:**
- Motor stabilization delays
- Calibration routines
- Multi-sample data collection
- Any loop with delays between iterations

**When NOT needed:**
- Quick command-response cycles (<200ms)
- Operations that naturally send frequent commands
- GUI applications (gpio_controller handles this internally)

### Files Modified/Created

- `tests/gpio/test_motor_vibration_calibration.py` (new):
  - Simplified calibration script with heartbeat pattern
  - Tests 4 voltage levels (1.5V, 2.0V, 2.5V, 3.0V)
  - 5 samples per voltage

- `tests/gpio/test_motor_off_baseline.py` (new):
  - Measures baseline vibration with motor OFF
  - 10 samples for statistical confidence

- `tests/gpio/test_vibration_quick.py` (new):
  - Quick validation test (2 seconds)
  - Demonstrates heartbeat pattern

- `calibration_data/motor_calibration_20251027_144112.csv`:
  - Complete calibration dataset

- `calibration_data/README.md`:
  - Calibration results and threshold recommendations

### Recommendations

1. **Always send heartbeats during delays >500ms** - Arduino watchdog is unforgiving
2. **Break long operations into chunks** - Don't rely on single long delays
3. **Test with actual hardware timing** - Simulators won't catch watchdog timeouts
4. **Monitor for reset messages** - "TOSCA Safety Watchdog v2.0" in output = reset happened
5. **Use background heartbeat pattern** - For GUI applications, controller handles this automatically
