# SESSION_STATE.md

## Session Metadata
- Session ID: 2025-10-28-0230
- Timestamp: 2025-10-28 02:30:00 UTC
- Git HEAD: 0c741f8
- Current Branch: main
- Status: CLEAN

## Current Context
Phase: Onboarding_System_Phase_2_Complete
Sprint: AI Onboarding & Memory Optimization Initiative
Last Action: Completed Phase 2 (Onboarding system with SESSION_STATE, checkpoint guide, ONBOARDING.md, START_HERE deprecation)

## Active Work
Todos (from TodoWrite):
- [✅] Phase 1.1-1.4: SESSION_STATE system complete (checkpoint, guide, command)
- [✅] Phase 2.1-2.3: Onboarding optimization complete (ONBOARDING.md, START_HERE redirect)
- [⏳] Phase 3.1-3.3: Archive compression pending (HISTORY.md, WORK_LOG compression, INDEX.md)
- [⏳] Phase 4: DECISIONS.md pending
- [⏳] Phase 5: Testing and validation pending

Progress: 7/12 tasks complete (58%)

Unstaged Changes: NONE
Staged Changes: NONE

## Next Recommended Action
RECOMMENDED: Begin Phase 3 (Archive Compression)

**Phase 3 Tasks:**
1. Create HISTORY.md with October 2025 compressed summary
2. Compress WORK_LOG.md from 1200+ lines to <300 lines (40x reduction algorithm)
3. Create presubmit/archive/INDEX.md with keyword search capability
4. Move old summaries to presubmit/archive/YYYY-MM_summary.md format

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** High - Complete memory optimization initiative

**Why Phase 3 Matters:**
- Reduces AI context consumption by 75%+
- Enables fast historical lookup via keyword search
- Preserves all information in compressed, searchable format
- Completes the three-tier information architecture

## Recent Decisions
- [2025-10-28] Completed Phase 2: Single ONBOARDING.md entry point replaces 6-document process
- [2025-10-28] Created SESSION_STATE checkpoint system with 4 trigger categories
- [2025-10-28] Documented complete checkpoint algorithm in SESSION_CHECKPOINT_GUIDE.md
- [2025-10-28] Added /checkpoint slash command for manual safety checkpoints
- [2025-10-28] Deprecated START_HERE.md in favor of streamlined ONBOARDING.md
