   - Required vs recommended tools
   - References to documentation

2. **"Tool Workflow Patterns"**
   - Session start pattern
   - New module pattern
   - Bug investigation pattern
   - Code quality pattern
   - Gradual adoption timeline

3. **"Required vs Optional Tools"**
   - 5 REQUIRED scenarios
   - 5 RECOMMENDED scenarios
   - Clear distinction for AI decision-making

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Non-Overwhelming Integration

**Problem:** 80+ tools could be overwhelming
**Solution:**
- Created 2-tier documentation (quick guide + comprehensive reference)
- Focus on triggers, not tool catalog
- Gradual 4-week adoption plan
- Clear REQUIRED vs RECOMMENDED distinction

### 2. Seamless Fit with Existing Workflow

**Problem:** Don't want to disrupt working system
**Solution:**
- Tools added to existing before/during/after checklists
- Memory search enhanced (not replaced)
- TodoWrite, WORK_LOG.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md unchanged
- Pre-commit hooks unchanged

### 3. Proactive, Not Reactive

**Problem:** AI waits for user to request tools
**Solution:**
- Labeled 5 scenarios as REQUIRED
- Session prompts include tool awareness
- CODING_STANDARDS.md has tool checklist
- Memory entities remind AI at startup

### 4. Fast Discoverability

**Problem:** AI needs to find right tool quickly
**Solution:**
- Quick reference tables in TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md
- Decision tree flowcharts
- Memory search returns tool info
- Session prompts list key tools upfront

---

## How It Works

### For Quick Sessions (30 seconds)

**User uses:** `QUICK_SESSION_PROMPT.md`

**AI automatically gets:**
```javascript
mcp__memory__search_nodes("AI Tool Usage")
// Returns:
// - Use specialized tools proactively
// - REQUIRED: memory search at startup
// - REQUIRED: codereview after modules
// - REQUIRED: precommit for safety
// - REQUIRED: planner for complex features
// - See TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md for triggers
```

**AI knows immediately:**
- Which tools are mandatory
- When to use them
- Where to find details

### For Comprehensive Sessions (5-10 minutes)

**User uses:** `FULL_SESSION_PROMPT.md`

**AI reads:**
- CODING_STANDARDS.md (includes tool usage section)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (unchanged)
- WORK_LOG.md (unchanged)

**AI learns:**
- All development rules (existing + tool usage)
- Complete project context
- Proactive tool triggers

### During Development

**AI checks triggers:**
```
Module complete? → Use mcp__zen__codereview (REQUIRED)
Found bug? → Use mcp__zen__debug (recommended)
Complex feature? → Use mcp__zen__planner (REQUIRED if 3+ modules)
Safety commit? → Use mcp__zen__precommit (REQUIRED)
Milestone reached? → Use mcp__memory__add_observations (REQUIRED)
```

**AI updates checklists:**
- Post-Action Checklist includes tool usage verification
- Before/during/after workflow includes tool steps

## Testing the Integration

### Test 1: Quick Session Startup

**Objective:** Verify fast context loading with tool awareness

**Steps:**
1. Start new AI session
2. Copy-paste from `QUICK_SESSION_PROMPT.md`
3. AI should use `mcp__memory__search_nodes` to query "AI Tool Usage"
4. AI should confirm understanding of tool triggers

**Expected Result:**
- Session startup < 1 minute
- AI mentions tool usage awareness
- AI can list 5 REQUIRED tools

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AI uses memory search (not file reading)
- ✅ AI mentions specialized tools proactively
- ✅ Session faster than traditional file-reading approach

### Test 2: Module Completion Review

**Objective:** Verify AI uses codereview proactively

**Steps:**
1. Tell AI: "I just finished implementing the GPIO controller"
2. Observe if AI uses `mcp__zen__codereview` without being asked
3. Check if AI marks it as REQUIRED in CODING_STANDARDS.md

**Expected Result:**
- AI automatically runs code review
- AI doesn't wait for user to request it
- AI explains this is a required quality check

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AI uses mcp__zen__codereview proactively
- ✅ AI provides findings from review
- ✅ AI updates memory if issues found

### Test 3: Bug Investigation

**Objective:** Verify AI uses systematic debugging

**Steps:**
1. Tell AI: "The camera is dropping frames intermittently"
2. Check if AI uses `mcp__zen__debug` for investigation
3. Observe systematic approach vs ad-hoc debugging

**Expected Result:**
- AI uses mcp__zen__debug for systematic investigation
- AI tracks hypothesis and confidence levels
- AI documents lesson learned in memory

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AI uses mcp__zen__debug (not print statements)
- ✅ AI follows systematic debugging process
- ✅ AI updates memory with lesson learned

### Test 4: Gradual Adoption Tracking

**Objective:** Track adoption over 4 weeks

**Metrics to Track:**

| Week | Focus | Metric | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Startup | Session startup time | < 1 min |
| 1 | Exploration | Use Task(Explore) vs Grep | 80% Task |
| 2 | Quality | Proactive codereview | 100% modules |
| 2 | Debugging | Use debug tool | 80% bugs |
| 3 | Planning | Use planner for complex | 100% complex |
| 3 | Validation | Use precommit for safety | 100% safety |
| 4 | Memory | Update after milestone | 100% milestones |
| 4 | Overall | Tool diversity | 20+ tools |

## Quick Start for Next Session

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended for Daily Use)

Copy-paste this:
```
I'm working on the TOSCA Laser Control System.

Search the MCP knowledge graph for:
1. "TOSCA Project" - Get current project status and phase
2. "TodoWrite Workflow" - Learn task tracking guidelines
3. "Git Content Policy" - Understand content rules
4. "Hardware API Usage Rule" - Critical development rule
5. "Development Workflow" - Get workflow guidelines
6. "Presubmit Folder" - Understand documentation system
7. "AI Tool Usage" - Learn specialized tool triggers

Then tell me:
- Current project status and what we were last working on
- What you recommend as next steps
- Confirm you understand the critical rules (Hardware API, Git Content, TodoWrite)

**Tool Usage Awareness:**
- Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes` at session start (you just did this ✓)
- Use `Task(Explore)` for codebase exploration (not manual Grep)
- Use `mcp__zen__codereview` AFTER completing modules (proactive)
- Use `mcp__zen__debug` for non-trivial bugs (systematic)
- Use `mcp__zen__planner` for complex features (plan first)
- See `presubmit/reference/TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for triggers

**Repository:** https://github.com/will-aleyegn/TOSCA_DEV.git
**Working Directory:** C:\Users\wille\Desktop\TOSCA-dev
```

### Option 2: Comprehensive Start (First Session or Major Changes)

Use `FULL_SESSION_PROMPT.md` - now includes tool usage

### Option 3: Just Add Tool Awareness to Existing Prompt

Add this line to any existing prompt:
```
Also search MCP memory for "AI Tool Usage" and confirm you understand when to use specialized tools proactively.
```

## Maintenance

### When to Update Documentation

**TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md:**
- When discovering new effective tool combinations
- When adding new required scenarios
- After 4-week adoption (refine based on experience)

**AI_TOOL_USAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md:**
- When adding detailed examples
- When documenting new workflows
- For major Claude Code tool updates

**Memory Entities:**
- After milestone completion (add observations)
- When discovering new tool patterns
- When changing REQUIRED tool list

### Keeping It Current

**Monthly review:**
- Check if REQUIRED tools are being used
- Review metrics (startup time, code review frequency)
- Update workflows based on what works

**After major changes:**
- Update memory entities
- Refine tool triggers
- Add new examples

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: AI not using tools proactively

**Diagnosis:**
- Check if session prompt includes tool awareness
- Verify memory search returns "AI Tool Usage"
- Check if CODING_STANDARDS.md was read

**Solution:**
- Remind AI: "Check TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md for required tools"
- Explicitly ask: "Should you use a specialized tool here?"
- Update session prompt to emphasize proactive usage

### Problem: AI using wrong tools

**Diagnosis:**
- Check trigger in TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md
- Verify AI understood the task correctly

**Solution:**
- Point AI to decision tree in guide
- Ask AI to explain which trigger applies
- Update guide if trigger is unclear

### Problem: Too many tools being used

**Diagnosis:**
- AI may be over-applying recommendations
- Check if REQUIRED vs RECOMMENDED is clear

**Solution:**
- Remind AI about gradual adoption
- Focus on REQUIRED tools only initially
- Emphasize Week 1-4 phasing
