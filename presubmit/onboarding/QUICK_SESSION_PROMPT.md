## Copy-Paste This Entire Prompt

```
I'm working on the TOSCA Laser Control System.

Search the MCP knowledge graph for:
1. "TOSCA Project" - Get current project status and phase
2. "TodoWrite Workflow" - Learn task tracking guidelines
3. "Git Content Policy" - Understand content rules
4. "Hardware API Usage Rule" - Critical development rule
5. "Development Workflow" - Get workflow guidelines
6. "Presubmit Folder" - Understand documentation system

Then tell me:
- Current project status and what we were last working on
- What you recommend as next steps
- Confirm you understand the critical rules (Hardware API, Git Content, TodoWrite)
