# Architecture Documentation Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Verified By:** AI Architecture Analysis
**Status:** VERIFIED - Implementation matches Selective Shutdown Policy

---

## Verification Summary

✅ **VERIFIED:** Actual implementation (`src/core/safety.py`) correctly implements **selective shutdown** policy (laser only).

✅ **VERIFIED:** Documentation now updated to match implementation.

---

## Implementation Verification

### Selective Shutdown Policy Compliance

**Policy (SAFETY_SHUTDOWN_POLICY.md v1.1):**
- Treatment laser: DISABLED on safety fault
- Camera: MAINTAINED
- Actuator: MAINTAINED
- Aiming laser: MAINTAINED
- GPIO monitoring: MAINTAINED

**Implementation (src/core/safety.py lines 100-113):**

```python
def trigger_emergency_stop(self) -> None:
    """
    Trigger emergency stop.

    Immediately disables laser and sets emergency stop state.
    """
    logger.critical("EMERGENCY STOP ACTIVATED")
    self.emergency_stop_active = True
    self.state = SafetyState.EMERGENCY_STOP
    self.laser_enable_permitted = False  # ← Only disables laser

    self.safety_state_changed.emit(self.state)
    self.laser_enable_changed.emit(False)
    self.safety_event.emit("emergency_stop", "ACTIVATED")
```

### Verification Results

✅ **Laser Control:** Only `laser_enable_permitted` flag is set to False

✅ **No Actuator Stop:** No code stopping actuator (correct - stays operational)

✅ **No Camera Stop:** No code stopping camera (correct - stays operational)

✅ **Signals:** Emits signals but doesn't directly shutdown other hardware

✅ **State Management:** Sets safety state to EMERGENCY_STOP but maintains system operation

### How It Works

The SafetyManager implements selective shutdown through **permission flags** rather than direct hardware control:

1. **Emergency Stop Trigger:**
   - Sets `laser_enable_permitted = False`
   - Emits `laser_enable_changed(False)` signal
   - Hardware controllers (laser, camera, actuator) listen to signals

2. **Laser Controller Response:**
   - Listens to `laser_enable_changed` signal
   - When False, disables laser output
   - Sets power to 0

3. **Camera & Actuator:**
   - Do NOT listen to `laser_enable_changed` signal
   - Continue normal operation
   - Remain controllable for assessment and repositioning

4. **GPIO Monitoring:**
   - SafetyManager continues to function
   - Continues monitoring interlock states
   - Provides diagnostic information

### Conclusion

✅ **Implementation is CORRECT and matches selective shutdown policy.**

The architecture uses a **signal-based coordination pattern** rather than direct hardware shutdown, which naturally implements selective shutdown:
- Only laser controllers respond to laser_enable signals
- Other systems (camera, actuator) are independent
- This is the correct implementation approach

## Documentation Updates Completed

### Files Updated (P0 Critical Fixes)

1. **03_safety_system.md**
   - ✅ Updated `_emergency_shutdown` code to show selective shutdown
   - ✅ Removed `self.hardware.actuator.stop()` line (was wrong)
   - ✅ Added clarification comments about what remains operational
   - ✅ Updated docstring to reference SAFETY_SHUTDOWN_POLICY.md
   - ✅ Updated `disable_laser` method with clarification

2. **01_system_overview.md**
   - ✅ Updated status: "Planning Phase" → "Phase 5 - Testing & Quality Assurance"
   - ✅ Updated date: 2025-10-15 → 2025-10-26
   - ✅ Added protocol engine note pointing to action-based model (06_protocol_builder.md)
   - ✅ Marked step-based protocol as legacy

3. **04_treatment_protocols.md**
   - ✅ Added prominent deprecation warning at top
   - ✅ Points to 06_protocol_builder.md as current implementation

4. **File Rename**
   - ✅ Renamed 06_safety_watchdog.md → 07_safety_watchdog.md
   - ✅ Fixed naming collision

5. **Cross-References**
   - ✅ Added policy reference in 03_safety_system.md after emergency_stop code
   - ✅ Clarified selective shutdown throughout safety documentation

## Remaining Work

### P1: High Priority (Before Next Phase)

**Hardware Documentation Updates:**
- [ ] Update FT232H references to Arduino Nano COM4
- [ ] Update pyfirmata references to correct serial protocol
- [ ] Add migration notes

**Additional Documentation:**
- [ ] Document encryption strategy
- [ ] Create test architecture doc (08_test_architecture.md)
- [ ] Update last modified dates on all architecture docs

### P2: Quality Improvements

**New Documentation Needed:**
- [ ] 08_concurrency_model.md - Threading model
- [ ] 09_event_logging.md - Event logging architecture
- [ ] 10_recording_manager.md - Recording system design
- [ ] 11_calibration_procedures.md - Calibration workflow
