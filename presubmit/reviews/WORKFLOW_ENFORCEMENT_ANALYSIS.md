# Workflow Enforcement Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Purpose:** Review current documentation update rules and identify gaps in enforcement

---

## Current Documentation Update Rules

### üìã What SHOULD Happen (Per Documentation)

#### From presubmit/README.md:

**Every significant action:**
1. Update `active/WORK_LOG.md` with what you did
2. If milestone reached, update `active/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
3. Commit code changes to git
4. Pre-commit hook will remind you (but won't block)

**Update Frequency Table:**
| File | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `active/WORK_LOG.md` | After every significant action | Action tracking |
| `active/PROJECT_STATUS.md` | After major milestones | Complete state |
| `active/NEXT_STEPS.md` | When priorities change | Roadmap |
| `reference/*.md` | Rarely (policies change) | Stable reference |

#### From Development Workflow (MCP Memory):

**Before work:**
- Read GIT_CONTENT_POLICY.md
- Check PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Review WORK_LOG.md

**Before commit:**
- Run pre-commit hooks
- Verify no prohibited content
- Update WORK_LOG.md

**After milestone:**
- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md

---

## What Is ACTUALLY Enforced

### ‚úÖ Enforced (Pre-commit hooks)

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Black formatting
   - Flake8 linting
   - MyPy type checking
   - isort import ordering
   - Trailing whitespace removal
   - File size limits

2. **Reminder Display:**
   - Pre-commit hook shows reminder message
   - Does NOT block commits
   - Does NOT verify compliance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Suggested But Not Enforced

1. **WORK_LOG.md updates** - Reminder only, no verification
2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md updates** - No tracking of when milestones occur
3. **LESSONS_LEARNED.md** - Required in CODING_STANDARDS.md but no automation
4. **TodoWrite usage** - NOT mentioned in any documentation
5. **Code review checklist** - Manual process, no automation

---

## Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: TodoWrite Tool Not Documented

**Problem:**
- TodoWrite tool exists and is used during sessions
- No mention in CODING_STANDARDS.md
- No mention in Development Workflow
- No enforcement or guidelines

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent task tracking across sessions
- AI may or may not use todos
- No way to verify task completion

**Current Behavior:**
- AI receives reminders to use TodoWrite from system
- User can see todo list in UI
- But no formal documentation on WHEN to use it

### Gap 2: WORK_LOG.md Updates Not Verified

**Problem:**
- Pre-commit reminder says "Update WORK_LOG.md"
- No verification that it was actually updated
- Easy to ignore reminder and commit anyway

**Impact:**
- Work logs may fall behind reality
- Session continuity at risk
- Future AI sessions missing context

**Current Behavior:**
- Reminder displays
- Developer can ignore it
- Commit proceeds either way

### Gap 3: Milestone Detection Not Automated

**Problem:**
- PROJECT_STATUS.md should update "after major milestones"
- No definition of what constitutes a "major milestone"
- No automated detection or enforcement

**Impact:**
- Subjective judgment on when to update
- May miss important status changes
- Status document becomes stale

**Current Behavior:**
- Relies on developer judgment
- No prompting or verification

### Gap 4: LESSONS_LEARNED.md Not Tracked

**Problem:**
- CODING_STANDARDS.md requires LESSONS_LEARNED.md files
- States "Update LESSONS_LEARNED.md BEFORE committing the fix"
- No pre-commit verification that lessons were documented
- No enforcement mechanism

**Impact:**
- Lessons may not be documented
- Same mistakes repeated across modules
- Knowledge loss between sessions

**Current Behavior:**
- Manual discipline only
- No automation or checking

### Gap 5: Code Review Checklist Not Automated

**Problem:**
- CODING_STANDARDS.md has 13-item checklist
- First two items are CRITICAL (Hardware API usage)
- No automated checking
- Relies entirely on manual review

**Impact:**
- Checklist items may be skipped
- Hardware API rule violations possible
- Code quality depends on discipline

**Current Checklist Items:**
- [ ] HARDWARE API: Used native hardware features
- [ ] HARDWARE API: Checked manufacturer docs
- [ ] Every function is necessary
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No TODO without tickets
- [ ] No placeholder implementations
- [ ] All docstrings accurate and minimal
- [ ] Type hints on all functions
- [ ] Error handling for hardware/IO
- [ ] No debug print statements
- [ ] No emojis or decorative elements
- [ ] Passes all linters

---

## What Should Be Skipped vs Enforced

### ‚úÖ Keep Current Approach (Reminders, Not Blockers)

**Philosophy:** Trust-based development with gentle nudges

**Reasoning:**
1. **WORK_LOG.md updates** - Sometimes you commit partial work
2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md updates** - Not every commit is a milestone
3. **Documentation writing** - Sometimes document after implementation
4. **Session summaries** - Optional, not every session needs one

**Benefits:**
- Flexibility for developer workflow
- Doesn't interrupt flow state
- Avoids `--no-verify` bypassing

**Risks:**
- Documentation drift
- Context loss
- Forgotten updates

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider Adding Enforcement

#### Option A: Stricter Pre-Commit Checks (Not Recommended)

**What it would do:**
- Block commits if WORK_LOG.md not updated in last 5 minutes
- Require milestone confirmation dialog
- Check for LESSONS_LEARNED.md entries when certain files changed

**Pros:**
- Guarantees documentation updates
- Forces discipline

**Cons:**
- Annoying developer experience
- Will be bypassed with `--no-verify`
- Interrupts flow
- False positives (batch commits, cleanup commits, etc.)

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå Do NOT implement

#### Option B: Enhanced TodoWrite Usage (Recommended)

**What it would add:**
- Document TodoWrite in CODING_STANDARDS.md
- Add TodoWrite to Development Workflow
- Create guidelines on when to use todos
- Update MCP memory with todo workflow

**Pros:**
- Better task tracking
- Clear completion criteria
- Helps AI stay organized
- Non-intrusive (doesn't block commits)

**Cons:**
- Adds slight overhead
- Requires discipline

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Implement

#### Option C: Post-Commit Summary Prompt (Recommended)

**What it would do:**
- After commit, prompt: "Did you update WORK_LOG.md?"
- Non-blocking, just asks
- Could track statistics over time

**Pros:**
- Gentle reminder at right time
- Educates good habits
- Non-blocking

**Cons:**
- Requires tooling support
- May be ignored like current reminder

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Consider for future enhancement

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

#### 1. Document TodoWrite Usage in CODING_STANDARDS.md

**Add new section:**

```markdown
## Task Tracking with TodoWrite

### When to Use Todos

**Always create todos for:**
- Multi-step features (3+ distinct steps)
- Non-trivial tasks requiring planning
- User provides list of multiple tasks
- Complex debugging or investigation work

**Skip todos for:**
- Single straightforward tasks
- Trivial 1-2 step changes
- Pure conversation/questions

### Todo Lifecycle

**Before starting work:**
1. Break down task into discrete steps
2. Create todos with TodoWrite tool
3. Set first todo to `in_progress`

**During work:**
1. Update current todo to `completed` IMMEDIATELY after finishing
2. Set next todo to `in_progress` BEFORE starting it
3. Add new todos if work scope expands

**Task States:**
- `pending` - Not yet started
- `in_progress` - Currently working (ONLY ONE at a time)
- `completed` - Finished successfully

### Integration with Documentation

Todos complement, not replace, WORK_LOG.md:
- **Todos:** Track current session progress
- **WORK_LOG.md:** Permanent record of what was done
- **Both:** Updated as work proceeds
```

#### 2. Update Development Workflow in MCP Memory

**Add observations:**
- "Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks to track progress"
- "Update todos in real-time: completed ‚Üí in_progress flow"
- "Todos visible to user, provide transparency"

#### 3. Create TodoWrite Guidelines Document

**New file:** `presubmit/reference/TODO_GUIDELINES.md`

**Contents:**
- When to use TodoWrite vs when to skip
- Best practices for todo descriptions
- Examples of good todo breakdowns
- Integration with WORK_LOG.md

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Add Post-Action Checklist to CODING_STANDARDS.md

**Add section:**

```markdown
## Post-Action Checklist

After completing any significant work:

**If you used TodoWrite:**
- [ ] All todos marked `completed` or updated
- [ ] Final todo matches actual work done
- [ ] Todos cleaned up (no stale entries)

**Documentation:**
- [ ] WORK_LOG.md updated with action entry
- [ ] PROJECT_STATUS.md updated if milestone reached
- [ ] LESSONS_LEARNED.md updated if you discovered API quirks
- [ ] MCP memory updated if major changes

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] Manual code review checklist complete
- [ ] Hardware API usage rule followed
```

#### 5. Enhance Pre-Commit Reminder Message

**Update `presubmit/REMINDER.txt`:**

```
================================================================
                 DOCUMENTATION REMINDER
================================================================

Before committing code changes:

  * Update WORK_LOG.md with new action entry
  * Update PROJECT_STATUS.md if milestone reached
  * Update LESSONS_LEARNED.md if you fixed bugs or found API quirks
  * Mark todos as completed if you used TodoWrite
  * Verify documentation reflects current work state

This is a REMINDER ONLY - commit will proceed regardless.

================================================================
```

### Low Priority / Future Enhancements

#### 6. Create Automated Checklist Verification (Future)

**Possible approach:**
- Pre-commit hook that SUGGESTS checklist items based on files changed
- Example: "You modified camera_controller.py - did you check Hardware API usage?"
- Still non-blocking, just informative

#### 7. Add Session Statistics Tracking (Future)

**Track metrics:**
- WORK_LOG.md update frequency
- Time since last PROJECT_STATUS.md update
- Number of commits between doc updates
- Display stats at session start

**Benefits:**
- Visibility into documentation health
- Early warning of drift

---

## Proposed TodoWrite Enforcement Level

### Recommended Approach: Soft Guidelines

**What this means:**
- TodoWrite is RECOMMENDED for complex tasks
- AI will receive guidelines on when to use it
- Not enforced by pre-commit hooks
- User can request todos or not

**Documentation will state:**
- "Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks"
- Examples of when to use vs skip
- Best practices for todo management

**AI behavior:**
- System reminders will continue
- AI will proactively use for complex work
- AI will ask if uncertain

**User control:**
- User can disable TodoWrite reminders
- User can request explicit todo tracking
- User always sees current todos

### Alternative: Strict Todo Requirement (Not Recommended)

**What this would mean:**
- EVERY task requires TodoWrite
- Pre-commit hook verifies todos were used
- Blocks commit if todos not completed

**Why NOT recommended:**
- Too rigid for flexible workflows
- Adds unnecessary overhead for simple tasks
- Will be bypassed with `--no-verify`
- Doesn't match "minimal intervention" philosophy

---

## Summary: Current State vs Ideal State

### Current State

**What's Working:**
‚úÖ Code quality enforced (Black, Flake8, MyPy)
‚úÖ Pre-commit reminder displays
‚úÖ Documentation exists and is organized
‚úÖ Clear file update frequency guidelines
‚úÖ Git Content Policy enforced manually

**What's Missing:**
‚ùå TodoWrite not documented
‚ùå No verification of WORK_LOG.md updates
‚ùå No milestone detection automation
‚ùå LESSONS_LEARNED.md not tracked
‚ùå Code review checklist not automated

### Ideal State (After Recommendations)

**What will improve:**
‚úÖ TodoWrite documented in CODING_STANDARDS.md
‚úÖ Clear guidelines on when to use todos
‚úÖ Enhanced pre-commit reminder includes lessons learned
‚úÖ Post-action checklist added
‚úÖ MCP memory updated with todo workflow
‚úÖ TODO_GUIDELINES.md reference document

**What will stay the same (intentionally):**
‚ö†Ô∏è Non-blocking reminders (no enforcement)
‚ö†Ô∏è Trust-based documentation updates
‚ö†Ô∏è Manual code review checklist
‚ö†Ô∏è Flexible workflow (not rigid)

- C) Create interactive pre-commit questionnaire
- D) Combine: Automate what's automatable, manual for rest

**Recommendation:** D (hybrid approach)

### Question 5: Documentation Update Verification

**Should we verify WORK_LOG.md was actually updated?**

Options:
- A) No verification, reminder only (status quo)
- B) Check if file modified in last N minutes
- C) Post-commit prompt asking if updated
- D) Track statistics but don't block

**Recommendation:** A or C (reminder or post-commit prompt)

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Documentation (Immediate - No Code Changes)

1. Add TodoWrite section to CODING_STANDARDS.md
2. Create TODO_GUIDELINES.md reference doc
3. Update presubmit/REMINDER.txt with LESSONS_LEARNED.md
4. Add post-action checklist to CODING_STANDARDS.md
5. Update MCP memory with todo workflow

**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Risk:** None (documentation only)
**Benefit:** Clear guidelines, better session consistency

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reminders (Low Risk)

1. Improve REMINDER.txt content
2. Add file-change-based suggestions (optional)
3. Create session statistics tracking (future)

**Effort:** 2-4 hours
**Risk:** Low (non-blocking)
**Benefit:** Better prompts at right time

### Phase 3: Automated Checklist Items (Medium Risk)

1. Add checks for automatable items (emojis, TODOs)
2. Create pre-commit suggestions based on files changed
3. Add post-commit summary prompt

**Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Risk:** Medium (may annoy if too aggressive)
**Benefit:** Catches common mistakes

---

## Conclusion

**Current enforcement philosophy: "Remind, don't block"**

This is appropriate for:
- Experienced developers
- Trust-based workflows
- Flexible development styles

**Recommended changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Document TodoWrite (soft guidelines)
2. ‚úÖ Enhance reminder messages
3. ‚úÖ Add post-action checklists
4. ‚ùå Do NOT add blocking enforcement
5. ‚ùå Do NOT require todos for every task

**Key principle:**
> "Provide clear guidance and helpful reminders, but trust the developer to follow them. Enforcement should focus on code quality (automated), not process compliance (manual)."

---

**Next Steps:**
1. User reviews this analysis
2. User decides on enforcement levels (Questions 1-5)
3. Implement Phase 1 documentation updates
4. Test new guidelines in practice
5. Iterate based on what works
