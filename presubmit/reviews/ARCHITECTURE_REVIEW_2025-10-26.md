# TOSCA Architecture Documentation Review

**Review Date:** 2025-10-26
**Reviewer:** AI Architecture Analysis (Gemini 2.5 Pro + Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Scope:** Complete architecture documentation review (8 documents, 5,482 lines)
**Confidence:** Very High

## Executive Summary

Your architecture documentation is **fundamentally sound** with exceptional safety-first design, but suffers from **critical documentation debt** that poses risks for development, onboarding, and regulatory compliance. The core architecture (layered design, safety interlocks, database schema) is appropriate for a medical device, but documentation has not kept pace with implementation evolution.

**Overall Grade: B (Good architecture, needs documentation sync)**

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Exceptional safety-first design with multi-layered interlocks
- ✅ Well-designed database schema with audit trail
- ✅ Clean layered architecture (UI → Core → HAL → Hardware)
- ✅ Selective shutdown policy shows architectural maturity

**Critical Issues:**
- 🔴 Safety policy contradiction (full vs selective shutdown)
- 🔴 Dual protocol engine documentation without clear deprecation
- 🔴 File naming collision (two docs numbered "06")
- 🟠 Outdated status fields ("Planning Phase" vs actual Phase 5)
- 🟠 Hardware documentation mismatch (FT232H vs Arduino Nano)
- 🟠 Undocumented threading model

---

## Critical Findings (Immediate Action Required)

### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Safety Policy Contradiction

**Issue:** Two conflicting shutdown policies documented

**User Confirmation:** **Selective shutdown (laser only) is CORRECT**

**Location:**
- `03_safety_system.md:317-323` - Describes **full hardware shutdown** (stops actuator, camera, all systems) ❌ WRONG
- `SAFETY_SHUTDOWN_POLICY.md:14-17` - Mandates **selective shutdown** (laser only, camera/actuator maintained) ✅ CORRECT

**Evidence:**
```python
# OLD POLICY (03_safety_system.md:317) - INCORRECT
self.hardware.laser.emergency_stop()
self.hardware.actuator.stop()  # ← This is WRONG - contradicts selective shutdown

# CORRECT POLICY (SAFETY_SHUTDOWN_POLICY.md:186)
self.laser_controller.set_output(False)
self.laser_controller.set_current(0.0)
# Camera continues streaming (for assessment)
# Actuator remains controllable (for repositioning)
```

**Impact:**
- Developers could implement wrong safety behavior
- **Life safety risk** if wrong policy implemented
- Regulatory audit failure

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Update `03_safety_system.md` lines 317-323 to match selective shutdown
2. ✅ Add cross-reference to `SAFETY_SHUTDOWN_POLICY.md` as canonical policy
3. ✅ Mark old full-shutdown approach as deprecated
4. ✅ Verify implementation matches selective shutdown policy

**Priority:** P0 - **Must fix before Phase 6**

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #2: Dual Protocol Engine Documentation

**Issue:** Two different protocol engines documented without clear deprecation

**Location:**
- `04_treatment_protocols.md` - Simple step-based protocol model (OLD)
- `06_protocol_builder.md:5` - Complex action-based model (NEW - states "Supersedes: Section of 04_treatment_protocols.md")

**Impact:**
- Unclear which model is canonical
- `01_system_overview.md` hasn't been updated
- Implementation confusion

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Add deprecation warning to top of `04_treatment_protocols.md`
2. ✅ Update `01_system_overview.md` to reflect action-based engine
3. ✅ Verify codebase implements new model

**Priority:** P0 - **Must fix before Phase 6**

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #3: File Naming Collision

**Issue:** Two documents numbered "06"

**Location:**
- `06_protocol_builder.md`
- `06_safety_watchdog.md`

**Impact:**
- Confusing navigation
- Suggests documentation management issues

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Rename `06_safety_watchdog.md` → `07_safety_watchdog.md`
2. ✅ Update any cross-references

**Priority:** P0 - **Quick fix** (5 minutes)

---

## High Priority Findings

### 🟠 HIGH #1: Outdated Status Fields

**Issue:** Documentation shows "Planning Phase" but project is Phase 5 Testing

**Location:** `01_system_overview.md:5`

**Evidence:**
```markdown
# docs/architecture/01_system_overview.md:5
**Status:** Planning Phase  ← WRONG

# presubmit/active/PROJECT_STATUS.md:4
**Current Phase:** Phase 5 IN PROGRESS - Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 1: 100% COMPLETE)  ← ACTUAL
```

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Update `01_system_overview.md` status to "Phase 5 - Testing & Quality Assurance"
2. ✅ Update "Last Updated" date to 2025-10-26
3. ✅ Update "Date" field to 2025-10-26

**Priority:** P1 - **Before next phase**

---

### 🟠 HIGH #2: Hardware Documentation Mismatch

**Issue:** Documents reference **FT232H** hardware but implementation uses **Arduino Nano COM4**

**Location:**
- `01_system_overview.md:128-143` - References FT232H, pyfirmata
- `03_safety_system.md:48-55` - References FT232H GPIO pins
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md:6` - Actual: "Arduino Nano GPIO on COM4 (migrated from FT232H)"

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Update `01_system_overview.md` to reference Arduino Nano COM4
2. ✅ Remove pyfirmata references, add correct serial protocol description
3. ✅ Update `03_safety_system.md` GPIO pin references
4. ✅ Add note about FT232H → Arduino Nano migration

**Priority:** P1 - **Before next phase**

---

### 🟠 HIGH #3: Undocumented Threading Model

**Issue:** Multiple concurrency mechanisms used but no central documentation

**Evidence Found:**
- **12 threading references** across 5 files
- `CameraController` uses `queue.Queue`
- `SafetyWatchdog` uses `threading.Thread`
- UI uses `pyqtSignal` and `QTimer`

**Missing Information:**
- Thread-safety of `GPIOController`, `SessionManager`
- Inter-thread communication patterns
- PyQt6 signal/slot integration strategy
- Which thread owns which hardware

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Create `08_concurrency_model.md`
2. ✅ Document primary threads (GUI, Camera, Hardware I/O)
3. ✅ Diagram inter-thread communication
4. ✅ Define thread-safety guarantees

**Priority:** P1 - **Before Phase 6**
