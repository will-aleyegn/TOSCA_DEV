## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### üö® Issue #1: Missing Watchdog Timer (SAFETY CRITICAL)
**Location:** `src/core/safety.py`

**The Problem:**
If the GUI freezes while the laser is ON, the laser will remain active indefinitely. There is NO automatic shutoff mechanism.

**What to Do:**
1. Read `improvements/04_WATCHDOG_TIMER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. Implement watchdog timer in `SafetyManager`
3. Add heartbeat mechanism to `MainWindow`
4. Test freeze scenarios thoroughly

**Timeline:** 4.5 days

---

### üö® Issue #2: Placeholder Safety Checks (SAFETY CRITICAL)
**Location:** `src/core/protocol_engine.py:463-471`

**The Problem:**
The `_perform_safety_checks()` method always returns `True` without checking ANY interlocks. Protocols can execute in unsafe states.

**What to Do:**
1. Update `ProtocolEngine` to accept `SafetyManager` dependency
2. Replace placeholder with real safety validation
3. Test that protocols are blocked when interlocks not satisfied

**Timeline:** 0.5 days

---

### üö® Issue #3: Hardcoded Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Location:** Multiple files (20+ hardcoded values)

**The Problem:**
COM ports, baudrates, safety limits, and other critical values are hardcoded. Cannot deploy to different environments without code changes.

**What to Do:**
1. Read `improvements/03_CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT.md`
2. Create `src/config/` module with Pydantic settings
3. Create `.env` file with all configuration
4. Migrate all hardcoded values (20+ locations)

**Timeline:** 5.5 days

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1-2: Address Critical Safety Issues
1. **Start with Configuration Management** (5.5 days)
   - Create config module first
   - Other improvements depend on this
   - Lowest risk, high impact

2. **Implement Watchdog Timer** (4.5 days)
   - Most critical safety issue
   - Requires config module to be done first

### Week 2-3: Architectural Improvements
3. **Refactor Dependency Injection** (3.5 days)
   - Improves testability
   - Makes code more maintainable

4. **Create Hardware Controller ABC** (5 days)
   - Removes 200+ lines of duplicated code
   - Makes adding new hardware easier

### Week 3-4: Quality Improvements
5. **Fix Placeholder Safety Checks** (0.5 days)
6. **Standardize Import Paths** (3.5 days)

## Success Criteria

When all improvements are implemented, you will have:

‚úÖ **Safety Hardened** - Watchdog prevents freeze-induced hazards
‚úÖ **Properly Configured** - All settings in `.env` files
‚úÖ **Well Architected** - Decoupled, testable, maintainable
‚úÖ **High Quality** - Consistent patterns, reduced duplication
‚úÖ **Fully Tested** - 80%+ test coverage with safety validation

**Total Effort:** ~23 days (~1 month with 1 developer)
**Status:** Ready to begin implementation
**Priority:** Critical safety issues first (watchdog + config)
