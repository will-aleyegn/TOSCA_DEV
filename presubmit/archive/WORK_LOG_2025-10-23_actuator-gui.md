#### 29. Xeryon API Verification and Compliance
**Time:** 12:30-13:00 (2025-10-23)
**What:** Comprehensive API verification against official Xeryon library, critical bug fixes

**Problem Discovered:**
  - User requested API verification against official Xeryon Python library
  - Found CRITICAL speed API bug: bypassing official conversion
  - Needed to clarify TOSCA hardware uses 9600 baud (NOT library default 115200)

**Files Created:**
  - components/actuator_module/docs/XERYON_API_REFERENCE.md (642 lines)
    - Complete API reference from official Xeryon.py v1.88
    - Prominent TOSCA hardware configuration section
    - All stage types, units, conversion formulas
    - Position control, speed control, homing procedures
    - Status monitoring (all 22 status bits documented)
    - Common usage patterns and examples
    - Quick reference table

**Files Modified:**
  - src/hardware/actuator_controller.py
    - Line 425: Fixed set_speed() to use axis.setSpeed() API
    - Lines 76-100: Added API compliance docstring to connect()
    - Lines 224-242: Added API compliance docstring to find_index()
    - Lines 291-308: Added API compliance docstring to set_position()
    - Lines 357-372: Added API compliance docstring to make_step()
    - Lines 399-447: Added detailed speed API docstring
    - All docstrings reference XERYON_API_REFERENCE.md sections

**Critical Fixes:**
  1. Speed API Bug:
     - Was: self.axis.sendCommand(f"SSPD={speed}") # NO unit conversion
     - Now: self.axis.setSpeed(speed) # Official API with µm/s conversion
     - Impact: GUI speed slider (50-500) now correctly interpreted as µm/s

  2. Baudrate Documentation:
     - Clarified TOSCA uses 9600 baud throughout all documentation
     - Added warnings that library default (115200) will NOT work
     - Updated all code examples to show correct 9600 value

  3. API Compliance Comments:
     - Every critical method documents official API behavior
     - Unit conversion behavior clearly explained
     - Links to API reference documentation
     - Hardware API Usage Rule compliance noted

**TOSCA Hardware Configuration Documented:**
  - Baudrate: 9600 (manufacturer pre-configured)
  - Stage Type: XLA_1250_3N (1.25 µm encoder)
  - Working Units: Units.mu (micrometers)
  - Speed Range: 50-500 µm/s

**Testing:**
  - ✓ All changes verified against official Xeryon.py v1.88
  - ✓ Speed conversion formula documented
  - ✓ Pre-commit hooks passing (black, flake8, isort, mypy)
  - ⏳ Physical hardware testing pending

**Commits:** 8cf072a (API reference), 561257c (speed fix + compliance)
**Result:** SUCCESS - All API calls verified, critical speed bug fixed
**Status:** Actuator HAL API-compliant and documented
**Next:** Test actuator widget with physical hardware

#### 30. Actuator GUI Development - Complete Control System
**Time:** 14:30-19:00 (2025-10-23)
**What:** Comprehensive actuator widget with limit protection, scanning, and tabbed UI

**Features Implemented:**

1. **Hardware Limit Protection & Safety**
   - Query LLIM/HLIM from device (±45000 µm range)
   - Validate all position commands before execution
   - Auto-stop scan at hardware limits
   - Real-time limit proximity warnings with color coding:
     - Green: > 5mm from limits (safe)
     - Yellow: 1-5mm from limits (warning)
     - Red: < 1mm from limits (danger)
   - Position range expanded from ±1500 to ±45000 µm

2. **Acceleration/Deceleration Control**
   - GUI sliders for ACCE/DECE (10000-65535 range)

   - Update hardware on slider release
   - Default: 65500 for both

3. **GUI Freezing Fixes**
   - Enabled non-blocking mode (DISABLE_WAITING=True)
   - Fixed API calls: getSetting() instead of getParameter()
   - All movements now non-blocking - GUI stays responsive

4. **Speed Control Improvements**
   - Normal mode: 500-10,000 µm/s (0.5-10 mm/s)
   - Fast mode: 500-400,000 µm/s (0.5-400 mm/s) - hardware max per XLA-5 manual
   - Default: 2000 µm/s (2 mm/s)
   - Display shows both µm/s and mm/s
   - Fast mode checkbox with warnings (disabled by default)

5. **Automated Scan Range Feature**
   - From/To position inputs (full ±45mm range)
   - Step size control (1-10,000 µm)
   - Dwell time at each position (0-10 seconds, non-blocking)
   - Loop continuously checkbox
   - Real-time progress display with percentage
   - Perfect for data collection, calibration sweeps

6. **Tabbed UI Reorganization**
   - Tab 1: Position Control (absolute + relative steps)

   - Tab 3: Settings (speed, acceleration, limits)
   - Compact status display (2x2 grid)
   - Color-coded connection/homing status
