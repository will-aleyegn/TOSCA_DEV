## Actuator HAL API Compliance (Complete)

**Xeryon API Verification:**
- [x] Complete API reference documentation (642 lines)
- [x] All API calls verified against official Xeryon.py v1.88
- [x] Critical speed API bug fixed
- [x] TOSCA hardware configuration documented
- [x] API compliance comments added to all methods

**Documentation Created:**
- [x] components/actuator_module/docs/XERYON_API_REFERENCE.md
  - Complete API reference from official library
  - TOSCA hardware configuration section
  - All stage types and units enumeration
  - Position control, speed control, homing procedures
  - Status monitoring (all 22 status bits)
  - Common usage patterns and examples
  - Quick reference table

**Code Fixes:**
- [x] src/hardware/actuator_controller.py
  - Fixed set_speed() to use axis.setSpeed() API (was bypassing conversion)
  - Added API compliance docstrings to connect()
  - Added API compliance docstrings to find_index()
  - Added API compliance docstrings to set_position()
  - Added API compliance docstrings to make_step()
  - Added detailed speed conversion documentation

**TOSCA Hardware Configuration:**
```
Actuator: Xeryon XLA-5-125-10MU
Baudrate: 9600 (manufacturer pre-configured, NOT library default 115200)
Stage Type: XLA_1250_3N (1.25 µm encoder resolution)
Working Units: Units.mu (micrometers)
Speed Range: 50-500 µm/s
```

**Critical Fixes:**
1. **Speed API Bug:**
   - Was: `self.axis.sendCommand(f"SSPD={speed}")` (no unit conversion)
   - Now: `self.axis.setSpeed(speed)` (official API with µm/s conversion)
   - Impact: GUI speed slider values now correctly interpreted as µm/s

2. **Baudrate Clarification:**
   - Documented TOSCA uses 9600 baud throughout all documentation
   - Added warnings that library default (115200) will NOT work
   - Updated all code examples to show correct 9600 value

3. **API Compliance:**
   - All methods reference official API behavior
   - Unit conversion formulas documented
   - Links to XERYON_API_REFERENCE.md added
   - Hardware API Usage Rule compliance noted

**Testing:**
- [x] All changes verified against official Xeryon.py v1.88
- [x] Speed conversion formula validated
- [x] Pre-commit hooks passing (black, flake8, isort, mypy)
- ⏳ Physical hardware testing pending

**Status:** Actuator HAL API-compliant and documented ✓
