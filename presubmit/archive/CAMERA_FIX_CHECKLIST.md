# Camera Display Bug Fix - Testing Checklist

## Fix Applied: âœ“

The camera display bug has been fixed in `src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py`.

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Close TOSCA if it's currently running
- [ ] Restart TOSCA application to load the fixed code
- [ ] Clear any cached Python bytecode (optional): `rm -rf src/ui/widgets/__pycache__/`

### Camera Connection Tests
- [ ] Connect to the camera successfully
- [ ] Camera status shows "Connected" (green)
- [ ] Start streaming without errors

### Display Validation Tests
- [ ] Full image is displayed (not just top half)
- [ ] No glitching or visual artifacts
- [ ] No horizontal tearing or distortion
- [ ] Image aspect ratio is correct
- [ ] Image is properly centered in display area

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Exposure slider works correctly
- [ ] Gain slider works correctly
- [ ] Auto exposure toggle works
- [ ] Auto gain toggle works
- [ ] Auto white balance toggle works

### Capture Tests
- [ ] Still image capture works
- [ ] Captured images are not corrupted
- [ ] Captured images show full frame (not half)

### Recording Tests
- [ ] Start/stop recording works
- [ ] Recorded videos are not corrupted
- [ ] Recorded videos show full frame (not half)
- [ ] FPS indicator updates correctly

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Frame rate is acceptable (should be similar to before fix)
- [ ] No significant CPU increase
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended streaming

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with different camera resolutions (if applicable)
- [ ] Test with grayscale mode (if camera supports it)
- [ ] Test with RGB/color mode
- [ ] Restart streaming multiple times
- [ ] Disconnect and reconnect camera

## Expected Results

### Before Fix (Buggy Behavior)
- Camera display showed only top half of image
- Bottom half was either black or glitching
- Possible memory corruption artifacts

### After Fix (Expected Behavior)
- Full camera image displayed correctly
- No glitching or artifacts
- Stable, clean video feed
- Proper pixel alignment

## If Issues Persist

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check Python version: `python --version`
2. Check numpy version: `python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"`
3. Check PyQt6 version: `python -c "from PyQt6.QtCore import PYQT_VERSION_STR; print(PYQT_VERSION_STR)"`
4. Verify file was modified: `git diff src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py`
5. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py`

### Check for Cached Code
```bash
# Remove Python cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete

# Restart TOSCA
```

### Verify Changes
```bash
# View the exact changes
git diff src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py

# Or view the specific lines
sed -n '583,598p' src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert the changes:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the backup file
cp src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py.backup.20251025_230240 src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py

# Option 2: Use git (if committed)
git checkout HEAD src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py

# Option 3: Use git stash
git stash
```

## Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
- [ ] Full camera image is visible (100% of frame, not 50%)
- [ ] No visual glitching or corruption
- [ ] Display is stable during streaming
- [ ] All camera controls work correctly
- [ ] Captures and recordings show full images

## Contact

If issues persist after this fix:
1. Check the TOSCA logs for camera-related errors
2. Review the camera controller implementation
3. Verify camera hardware/driver compatibility
4. Consider testing with a different camera (if available)

**Note**: This fix addresses the memory stride/bytes_per_line bug in QImage conversion.
If you're experiencing different camera issues (e.g., connection problems, low FPS,
driver issues), those would require separate investigation.
