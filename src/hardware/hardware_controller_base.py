"""
Abstract base class for all hardware controllers in TOSCA.

Enforces consistent interface across Camera, Actuator, Laser, and GPIO controllers.
Combines PyQt6's QObject (for signals/slots) with ABC (for interface enforcement).

Design Philosophy:
- Minimal interface - only what's truly common across all hardware
- PyQt6 signal/slot integration for thread-safe communication
- Optional event logging integration
- Type-safe with comprehensive type hints

All hardware controllers must:
1. Inherit from this base class
2. Implement connect() and disconnect() methods
3. Implement get_status() method
4. Emit connection_changed and error_occurred signals appropriately
